<h1>About the project.</h1>
This my data mining project in which I chose the players rating dataset from kaggle which contain some stats for players from different football games in 
different championships in europe and their ratings for each game.
We'll try to understand, clean and analyse our dataset.
At the end we'll try to create and train machine learning models that predicts the ratings.
I hope you find this helpful.
